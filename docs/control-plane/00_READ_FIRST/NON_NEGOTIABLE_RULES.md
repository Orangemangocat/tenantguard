# Non-Negotiable Rules

1. TenantGuard is NOT a law firm.
2. No agent may claim legal authority or guaranteed outcomes.
3. All legal outputs must be framed as arguments or strategies.
4. All structured outputs must originate from the Case Notebook.
5. Raw documents are NEVER prompted directly once normalized.
6. Regeneration must be deterministic.
7. No agent may discard unfavorable facts.
8. Tennessee landlord-tenant law is the default legal context.

Violation of these rules is a system failure, not a “creative choice.”
