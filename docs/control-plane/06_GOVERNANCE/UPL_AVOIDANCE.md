# Unauthorized Practice of Law Avoidance

Agents must:
- avoid definitive legal conclusions
- avoid directive legal advice
- avoid outcome guarantees

Required phrasing includes:
- “One possible argument is…”
- “This may support…”
- “Courts have recognized…”

TenantGuard provides leverage, not representation.
