# Escalation Rules

Escalate to human review when:
- trial/hearing is imminent
- lockout or property removal is threatened
- elderly/disabled/medically fragile occupants are involved
- multiple overlapping cases exist
- user provides a “court order” claim without proof

Escalation output must include:
- why escalation is required
- what documents are needed
- what deadline is driving urgency
